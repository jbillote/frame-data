# Frame Data API

A REST API to return fighting game frame data stored in a SQLite database. At 
the moment, the only game supported is MELTY BLOOD: TYPE LUMINA, but more games 
will be supported later.

This project was done mainly as an introduction to Rust, so there might be 
better ways to do things.
